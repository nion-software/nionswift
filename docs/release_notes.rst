Release Notes
=============

Note: In order to release bug fixes in a timely manner, we try to publish Nion Swift releases on a regular basis.
Sometimes, though, as a consequence, bug fix releases will also include new features that are only partial steps
towards their final form. Instead of disabling these new partial features in bug fix releases, we choose to include
them for evaluation and feedback. If you encounter an issue or have feedback about these types of new features,
please contact us or `file issues
<https://github.com/nion-software/nionswift/issues>`_.

The display item feature makes possible line plots with multiple layers which can be reordered. Each

color and stroke color. Additional layers can be added by dragging and removed using the inspector.

The display item feature also make it possible to have two simultaneous views of a single data item
using the Display Copy command in the View menu.

The procedure for updating files from file version 12 to 13 is to open the library folder in the new version -- files
will be automatically updated, but may trigger a delay up to a couple minutes, depending on the size of the library. You
can switch between old versions of Nion Swift and new versions, but when you have fully verified the new data and are
only using the new version of Nion Swift, you can remove the old, unneeded data by removing the folder ``Nion Swift Data
12`` in the library folder.

* Fix bug in handling of Fourier mask data.
* Import now able to handle GIF and BMP directly.
* Import improvements to TIFF (contributed by Andreas Mittelberger).

Version 0.10.2, December 2, 2016
--------------------------------
* Extend TIFF_IO with 1-d, 2-d, 3-d, 4-d data, ImageJ compatibility (contributed by Andreas MittelBerger).
* Integrate grid browser, new thumbnail browser into display panel.
* Add cut, copy, paste support for graphics.

* Installer no longer includes Visual C++ 2013 Redistributable package.
* Linux installation now loads Python dynamically, allowing use of Python 3.5 on older systems.

This release brings an improved way of selecting data items to be displayed in display panels.
Click on a display panel (one without an acquisition controller) and press the 'v' key to
switch to a thumbnail browser view. Choosing new data items by clicking or using the arrow
keys will immediately display them in the display panel. Type 'v' again to return to regular
view.

Version 0.10.1, November 21, 2016
---------------------------------
* Fix bug where computed data not always updated properly during dragging.
* Fix DM importer for 3d data sets (move first dimension to last to match Nion Swift).
* Fix scale marker on spectrum images (was using wrong dimension).
* Add ability to specify data descriptor from API when creating extended data.
* Improve handling of metadata in data elements (affects DM importer).

Version 0.10.0, November 15, 2016
---------------------------------
* Display source and dependent thumbnails within each display panel for easier data item navigation.
* Add new script window accessible with Ctrl+K with predefined 'api' for interfacing using API.
* Add history and tab completion to new script window.
* Improvements to dark and gain normalization in some cameras (Orca).
* Rework 'computation' functionality to use API calls for more flexibility. See note below.
* Metadata is no longer copied from source to target during computations. See note below.
* Thumbnails are now rendered with more detail.
* Numerous inspector bug fixes and minor improvements.
* Numerous API improvements. See documentation and typing files for specific details.
* Add more calibration display options (pixels, calibrated, and relative). Edit using Calibration inspector.
* Add annular ring mask graphic (experimental).
* Tuning diagnostic arrows are now available on failed tuning runs.
* Capture button works more consistently for EELS camera.
* Fix some bugs in UI when switching modes on Camera.
* Simplified the threading within the library. See note below.

This release brings an improved way of seeing dependent and source data items in display panels.
Small thumbnails appear indicating source (bottom left) or dependent (bottom right) data items.
The small thumbnails can be dragged into display panels to be displayed.

Computations have changed in this version. Standard computations such as FFT or line profile that
were initially created using menu items should continue to work as expected. If you have entered a custom
computation to generate the data for a data item, the custom computation will need to be modified. Use
the menu item computations as examples on how to make the modifications.

Computations no longer copy metadata. We are working on a solution for gathering metadata in dependent
data items for an upcoming version.

The threading model within the library has been simplified. The result is more reliable data updates,
particularly during acquisition. The downside is potential performance issues if too much processing
is occurring during acquisition. In most cases, processing will be sped up (three or less processed items
occurring live).

Version 0.9.0, August 22, 2016
------------------------------
* Recording data via API no longer creates new data item for each acquisition.
* Extend data system to include descriptions of dimensions (sequence, collection, datum).
* Fix crash bug after Import Data menu command.

* Enter key on line plot with selected intervals will auto-scale to data in intervals.
* Add spot and wedge mask graphics (experimental). Add Fourer Filter menu item.
* Add display rate limiter. Improves performance.
* Add color map property for displays; add inspector for it; add display in histogram panel.
* Fix bugs with graphic item inspectors on ndim > 2 data.
* Fix bugs in threaded computations (single threaded for now). Improves performance unless many computations.
* Display statistics in calibrated units in histogram window.
* Add cursor intensity display when hovering over histogram window.
* Improve cursor display during live acquisition.
* Fix bugs in computation panel.

Data indexing has changed in this version. 2d and 1d data has not been affected. 3d data where
the signal is in the first index will have to be changed so that the signal is in the last index.
4d data should be organized into two collection indexes followed by two datum indexes. Existing
3d and 4d data is not automatically migrated since the information about how to migrate it is missing
in older versions. Please contact Nion for help in migrating 3d and 4d data sets to this version.

Version 0.8.2, June 17, 2016
----------------------------
* Change wording of split workspace panel menu commands.
* Provide automatic migration from old files to new files, but still leaves old file directory intact.

Version 0.8.0, May 3, 2016
--------------------------
* File version to 10 (was 8), uses 'Nion Swift Data 10' as internal data storage folder name.

* Disable automatic migration from file version 8 to 10. See note.

Procedure for updating files from 8 to 10 is to duplicate the 'Nion Swift Data' subfolder in your
library and rename the copy to be 'Nion Swift Data 10'. Then run Swift (or switch to the desired
library within Swift) and allow Swift to upgrade the files. Two copies of the files will now exist,
a set compatible with Swift 0.7 and a new set compatible with Swift 0.8. Changes to one set will
not affect the other set, making it easy to switch between versions.

Version 0.7.0, March 29, 2016

-------------------------------
* Switch to Python 3.5. You must use Nion Swift with Python 3.5 and NumPy 1.10.
* Add a 'Choose...' dialog in Switch Workspace sub-menu for loading previous workspace. This makes it easier to choose
  from numerous workspaces.
* New implementations of Python console and output windows. Some previous functionality (particularly up-arrow to
  repeat last command) is missing in new version.
* Fix another issue with exporting individual data items under Linux.
* Linux distribution now bundles Qt libraries. This eliminates the need to match the installed Qt version to the
  particular Nion Swift distribution.

Version 0.5.8, December 29, 2015
--------------------------------
* Add draggable acquisition thumbnails to each controller panel (SuperScan, Camera, etc.).
* Generate fewer data items by splitting library into persistent and temporary (live) sections and re-using existing
  data items for acquisition where possible.
* Ensure that old tuning images get deleted when starting tuning.
* Add ability to copy tuning output table from Task panel.
* Handle arrow keys in grid/list views. Also do a better job of keeping selection in view.
