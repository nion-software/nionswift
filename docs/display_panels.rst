Display Panels
--------------
Display panels are used to show display items.

You can drag items from the data panel into a display panel.

You can put keyboard focus on a display panel by clicking on it.

The display item with keyboard focus also serves as the primary selected item. Primary selections are indicated by a solid focus ring.

You can add secondary selected items by ``control`` clicking (Windows/Linux) or ``command`` (macOS) clicking on display panels. Secondary selections are indicated by a dotted focus ring.

Processing and other commands apply to the primary selected items. Processing commands that need multiple inputs may use secondary selected items.

To select multiple primary items, you need to use the data panel or a browser panel.
