Display Panels
==============

Display Panels
--------------
Display panels are used to show display items.

You can drag items from the data panel into a display panel.

You can put keyboard focus on a display panel by clicking on it.

The display item with keyboard focus also serves as the primary selected item. Primary selections are indicated by a solid focus ring.

You can add secondary selected items by ``control`` clicking (Windows/Linux) or ``command`` (macOS) clicking on display panels. Secondary selections are indicated by a dotted focus ring.

Processing and other commands apply to the primary selected items. Processing commands that need multiple inputs may use secondary selected items.

To select multiple primary items, you need to use the data panel or a browser panel.

Browsers
--------
Display panels can also show a browser, either as a thumbnail strip at the bottom of the display panel (thumbnail browser) or as a grid of display items (grid browser).

You can change the browser in a display panel by using the menu items :menuselection:`Display --> Thumbnail Browser` and :menuselection:`Display --> Grid Browser`. You can change to the single display item view by choosing the menu item :menuselection:`Display --> Display Item`.

You can also cycle between the display item, thumbnail, and grid browser by clicking on the display panel and pressing the :kbd:`v` key.

Finally, you can change to a single display item by double clicking on it in either the thumbnail or grid browser.

Note: If the display panel has an associated control bar, which is often present for live acquisition data, the :kbd:`v` key will not work.
