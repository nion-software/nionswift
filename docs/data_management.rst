Data Management
===============

Import/Exporting
----------------
When you import files, they are copied into your project as items and stored in an internal format.

You can also export items to files. The exported files can be used in other programs. Exporting a file does not remove it from your project.

Importing
+++++++++
You can import data from several data formats.

You can drag files directly into the data panel to import.

You can drag files directly into an empty display panel to import.

You can import files using the File > Import... menu item. This will allow you to select which files to import. The files will appear in your project.

You can import a folder of files using File > Import Folder... menu item. This will import all files that are importable within the folder. The files will appear in your project.

Exporting
+++++++++
You can export to several data formats.

The data format to which you are exporting must support data in the format of the data item you are choosing to export. For instance, you cannot export a 2D collection of 1D data to TIFF, which only supports images.

You can select which data items to export by selecting one or more items in the data panel and context clicking on one of the items and then choosing the Export... menu item.

You can also export the currently focused item by choosing File > Export...

You can also export an item in a display panel by context clicking on the display panel and choosing Export...
