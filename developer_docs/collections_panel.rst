Renaming Data Group
===================
The user should be able to rename a data group in the Collections panel by clicking on the data group and either hitting return or double-clicking the item. This will open a pop-up dialog that allows the user to edit the name of the data group.

The pop-up dialog should be positioned near the data group being renamed, and should take into account the current scroll position of the Collections panel.

The pop-up dialog should respond immediately to typing without requiring an additional focus click. The user can accept the new name by pressing return or cancel the operation by pressing escape.

The pop-up dialog should support standard text editing features such as copy, paste, cut, and select-all.

The pop-up dialog should be cancelled by clicking outside of the dialog or pressing escape.

The pop-up dialog should be cancelled by switching out of or exiting the application.
